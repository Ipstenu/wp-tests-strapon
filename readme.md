# WP-Tests-Strapon

Strap the WordPress PHPUnit tests library onto your WordPress plugin or theme with this handy Composer package.

This PHP Composer package facilitates the configuration and installation of a WordPress test environment so that WordPress' functionality can be used in your PHPUnit test suite.

In essence, it has the same purpose as the `install-wp-tests.sh` shell script installed by the WP-CLI scaffolder, but takes a more streamlined approach:

* It comes as a PHP Composer package, simplifying updates and maintainance, with no extra files in your own codebase
* Is 100% programmed in PHP, so it does not require skills beyond that to contribute to the project
* Has the same dependencies as one can expect from any WordPress development environment (the `cURL` and `ZipArchive` PHP modules)
* Does not depend on ancient technology that nobody should use anymore, such as Subversion
* The test environments are downloaded and configured automatically using your PHPUnit configuration file
* No need to re-run a script to install a development environment with the same parameters after every time you restart your computer or development environment

## Usage

WP-Tests-Strapon integrates with PHPUnit and acts as a bootstrap layer between your WordPress plugin's test suite. Simply run `./vendor/bin/phpunit` as you would generally do after following the installation instructions below.

## Installation

As this in an early development version of this package that has not been uploaded to Packagist yet, you are going to need to add the Git repository manually to your `composer.json` file in order to use Alda's WP-Tests-Strapon.

For the time being, you also need to set the `"minimum-stabiltiy"` attribute in your `composer.json` file to `"dev"`. (Yup, this may not be quite ready for production use, but it will change once the 0.1 release is out.)

Example:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/aldavigdis/wp-tests-strapon.git"
        }
    ],
    "minimum-stabiltiy": "dev"
}
```

Finally, Open up your PHPUnit configuration file (`phpunit.xml` or `phpunit.xml.dist`) and set the `bootstrap` attribute of the root `<phpunit>` element to `vendor/aldavigdis/wp-tests-strapon/bootstrap.php`.

Alternatively, you can include or require ``vendor/aldavigdis/wp-tests-strapon/bootstrap.php`` in your own PHPUnit bootstrap file.

### Example PHPUnit configuration file

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://schema.phpunit.de/11.0/phpunit.xsd"
    cacheResult="false"
    bootstrap="vendor/aldavigdis/wp-tests-strapon/bootstrap.php"
>
  <php>
    <env name="DB_NAME" value="myawesome_plugin_test" />
  </php>
  <testsuites>
    <testsuite name="Project Test Suite">
      <directory>tests</directory>
    </testsuite>
  </testsuites>
</phpunit>
```

## Environment variables and constants

You can set those in your `phpunit.xml` file, in your terminal session or in your test and production environments.

### PHPUnit Bootstrap

* `WP_TESTS_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` (constant): The location of your test environment's config file. Defaults to `/tmp/wp-tests-strapon/config.php` on Linux/Unix/macOS.
* `WP_VERSION` (environment variable): The PHP version to test against. Defaults to `master`.

### Config File Constants

The following constants will be set in your WordPress test configuration file:

* `WP_DEFAULT_THEME`
* `WP_TESTS_MULTISITE`
* `WP_DEBUG`
* `TABLE_PREFIX`
* `DB_NAME`
* `DB_USER`
* `DB_PASSWORD`
* `DB_HOST`
* `WP_TESTS_DOMAIN`
* `WP_TESTS_EMAIL`
* `WP_TESTS_TITLE`
* `WP_PHP_BINARY`
* `WPLANG`

The default values can be overridden when the file is generated by setting environment variables of the same name. You can do it using your PHPUnit configuration file, the PHPUnit runtime parameters, globally in your terminal or in your CI environment.

## Caveats

After WP-Tests-Strapon hand you over to PHPUnit and the WordPress test suite, you may seem the following text:

```txt
Running as single site... To run multisite, use -c tests/phpunit/multisite.xml
Not running ajax tests. To execute these, use --group ajax.
Not running ms-files tests. To execute these, use --group ms-files.
Not running external-http tests. To execute these, use --group external-http.
```

Those come from WordPress' own test suite and are related to testing WordPress itself. You should ignore those if you are only developing a plugin and are not using test groups of the same name.

## The Todo List

* Test the database connection when the config file is initialised
* Improve documentation
* Add more tests
* Add more glitter
* Test on a Mac
* Get Windows support sorted out (both CMD and PowerShell)
